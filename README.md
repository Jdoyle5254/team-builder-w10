## Description
This app can be used to create a team roster in HTML, based on command line user responses to a series of questions that creates a short employee profile based on the role of the employee: Manager, Engineer, Intern.  Once all the inputs have been completed, then a full roster of Manager, Intern, and Engineer can be displayed.  


## Installation
To install and run locally from Git Hub repository, got to the repository: https://github.com/Jdoyle5254/team-builder-w10 
Click CODE box, select SSH and copy the repository to your clipboard.
In your command-line navigate to the folder you want to hold the repository.
Once there type 'git clone' and paste the repository information into the line.
Once completed open the code in VS by typing the command code .
This will take you to VS Code and you will be in the repository on your local machine.  Once cloned,
create package.json using `npm init`.  The dependencies for this program are Inquirer and Jest.    

## Usage
Once installed, navigate to the folder with app.js and run Node to start the progrom in the command line.  The user should follow the prompts and answer the questions accordingly: 
Employee Name
Email
Employee Number
Select the role of the employee:  Manager, Engineer, Intern
If intern: School
If engineer: GitHub
If manager: office number

The user can continue to add as many roles/employees as needed, once done, on the final question, respond 'N' and the information input will print to the team.html in the output folder.
